# MUSA 508 Final

This repository holds the code for the Final Assignment of the MUSA 508, Public Policy Analysis, course at the University of Pennsylvania.
## Introduction
This project takes form as a scenario where we were contracted by New Jersey Transit to conduct predictive modeling on their transit network. This project focuses on 5 NJT rail lines that run into New York City. Our goal of this project was to assist NJT with capital improvement planning. 
## How To Use
Please refer to our RMD Markdown file for a published report on our predictive models including visuals and evaluation. The code is included in that file for replication.
